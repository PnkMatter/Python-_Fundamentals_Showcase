# 🐍 Python Fundamentals Showcase 🚀

Welcome to my Python Fundamentals repository! 👋 This collection of scripts is designed to demonstrate my understanding of core Python concepts. I've included a variety of small programs that showcase the building blocks of Python programming.

## ✨ What's Inside?

Here you'll find examples covering:

* **Printing & Basic Output:** Using `print()` to display information. 📝
* **Variables & Data Types:** Working with different types of data like integers, floats, strings, and booleans. 🔢🔤
* **Basic Operations:** Performing arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `**`) and comparison (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`) operations. ➕➖✖️➗
* **Conditional Statements:** Using `if`, `elif`, and `else` to control the flow of execution based on conditions. 🤔❓✅❌
* **Loops:**
    * `while` loops: Repeating blocks of code as long as a condition is true. 🔄
    * `for` loops: Iterating over sequences (like lists or strings - *though focusing on basics as requested, a simple `for` with `range()` could be here too*). 🚶‍♂️🚶‍♀️
* **User Input:** Getting input from the user using `input()`. 💬⌨️
* **Basic String Manipulations:** Simple operations on strings. ✂️📜

## 🎯 Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to:

* Solidify my understanding of Python's fundamental syntax and logic.
* Provide tangible examples of my foundational programming skills.
* Serve as a personal reference and a stepping stone for more complex projects. 🌟
